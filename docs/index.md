## Solution

Professionals and students struggle with setting, tracking, and achieving their goals. They often
use multiple platforms to manage their tasks, appointments, and goals, leading to disorganization
and inefficiency. Existing solutions may not offer seamless integration with commonly used calendar
applications like Google and Outlook, making it difficult for users to synchronize their goals and
tasks with their schedules. Furthermore, these solutions may not use advanced AI Large Language
Models (LLMs) to provide personalized goal recommendations and progress tracking.
